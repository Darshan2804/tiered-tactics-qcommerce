# Tiered Tactics: Pricing Strategy for Quick Commerce

A strategic pricing project developed for MGMT 682: Digital Product Design at Purdue University. This initiative rethinks monetization in India’s quick commerce space—focusing on Blinkit’s operational model to design tiered, segmented pricing strategies that balance cost-efficiency, user convenience, and sustainable profit growth.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Quick commerce platforms like Blinkit face a classic dilemma: **scale vs. profitability**. High delivery costs, price-sensitive consumers, and operational constraints pressure margins even as demand rises.

In this project, we analyzed Blinkit’s current model and proposed a **tiered pricing strategy** based on user urgency, city type, and order size. The goal? To **raise AOV**, **recover delivery costs**, and **improve gross margins**—all while maintaining brand trust and convenience.

## 🧠 Key Questions Addressed

- How can unit economics be optimized in quick commerce?
- What pricing levers drive profitability without user churn?
- How does geographic and behavioral segmentation influence price sensitivity?
- Can subscription models and bundled pricing boost loyalty and margins?
